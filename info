/abstracts
Contains all the sass tools, variables, mixins, functions, placeholders, etc.
We're using the \_global.scss to import all files so we don't bloat another file with these imports.

/base
Where we set the default styles, import custom fonts, set the default style for the headings, paragraphs, hyperlinks.

/components
These are independent, reusable pieces of the UI and you can think of components like a navbar, a header or a button.
We should create pages that are composed by components.

/pages
It contains the specific styles for each page with the filename being the name of the page.

/vendors
Contains all the third party files that the application needs. It can be a reset css file, bootstrap, anything you could think of.
